# phaser3-typescript-example

## Intro
I am learning the phaser3 game engine, and I want coding by Typescript. But There are only Javascript Example in Phaser Website. So I try to make this Javascript Example into Typescript Version. It also uses the "yarn" to manage all the package, and "webpack" to compile all files.
## Used
If you don't have "yarn" or "webpack", please install them at first.

[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/zh-Hans/docs/install#windows-stable)

[webpack](https://webpack.js.org/guides/installation/)

And then type "yarn build" in your command line. There will find "build" file in project. And in "src/project type/project/" find "index.html" file. Put it on web sever(you can use some tool, like "live-server" or "Preview on web-server"), And you will find the result.
